# TC2E-GF-118
The TC2E-GF-118 Golden Formula Paraflex subwoofer was originaly designed by Matthew Morgan J. member of the **Higher Order Quarterwave Society** (HOQWS) which was started in 2013 by Matthew Morgan J, Dustin Morgan (Flex Tech Designs) and J. Vansickle (Paragon Concepts) 

The TC2E-GF-118 subwoofer is based on a low and high tuned resonator making the design very efficient in it's bandwidth, which was named **Paraflex** for easy naming. Many prototypes and design revisions have been made by members of the HOQWS, continualy improving the design of the cabinet and its different versions.

Other designs using the Paraflex principles where made for midrange and infrasonic frequency ranges. There are always new concepts and designs in progress on the [HOQWS facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/bassaz/).
